# Implementation Summary - Version 5.2.1

## Overview
Successfully implemented all three requested improvements to the Chrome Plugin Emergent (Smart TimeZone Converter). The extension now provides a better user experience with more predictable tooltip behavior and comprehensive onboarding.

---

## 1. ✅ Fixed Tooltip Appearance on Mouse Release

### Problem
- Tooltip was appearing while the user was still dragging to select text

### Solution Implemented
- Added `isMouseDown` flag to track mouse button state
- Modified `handleMouseUp` to only process selection after button release
- Updated `handleSelectionChange` to ignore events while mouse is down
- Added proper state management to prevent premature tooltip display

### Code Changes
- **content/main.js**: Lines 44-45 (state variables)
- **content/main.js**: Lines 92-107 (mouse event handlers)
- **content/main.js**: Lines 133-136 (selection change logic)

---

## 2. ✅ Fixed Tooltip Cleanup Issues

### Problem
- Tooltips sometimes didn't disappear when deselecting text
- Multiple tooltips could overlap each other
- Tooltips persisted in certain edge cases

### Solution Implemented
- Created `hideTooltipImmediately()` function for instant removal
- Added cleanup on `mousedown`, `scroll`, `click`, and `blur` events
- Implemented proper tooltip timer management
- Added ESC key support for manual dismissal
- Ensured only one tooltip can exist at a time

### Code Changes
- **content/main.js**: Lines 435-449 (hideTooltipImmediately function)
- **content/main.js**: Lines 149-163 (click handler)
- **content/main.js**: Lines 165-171 (keyboard handler)
