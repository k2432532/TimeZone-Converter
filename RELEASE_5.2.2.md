# Version 5.2.2 Release Notes

## 🎨 Major UI Overhaul - Grayscale Theme

### Date: October 14, 2025
### Company: Latent - An Alpha OBS LLP Venture

---

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. CSP (Content Security Policy) Violations - RESOLVED
**Problem:** Extension was showing CSP errors preventing inline scripts
**Solution:** 
- Created external JavaScript file: `welcome/welcome.js`
- Removed all inline `<script>` tags from HTML
- Extension now complies with Chrome's security policies

**Before:**
```
❌ Refused to execute inline script because it violates CSP directive
```

**After:**
```
✅ No CSP errors - All scripts loaded externally
```
